# A second round of developing this page 2

In the last update earlier this evening, actually it was doing copy the given Markdown to a destination and rename it. I thought it was fine if it includes an image because I can simply have a check. Soon after that I realized that I should make the script also be able to distribute the mentioned image in Markdown file. If using a local image file, then also copy the image to correct location and rename it.  

Meanwhile, if I'm referring an online location ![Testing an online location](https://docs.python.org/3/_static/py.png) by an HTTPS URL, then just leave it unchanged.
