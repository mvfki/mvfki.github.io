# Updating posts more easily
This time I finally added the `GitPython` API to the distributor code. So that the only thing I need to do is first write an Markdown file, and second, run:
```{shell}
$ python pusher.py -f filename.md -d topic
Default browser will pop up in 3 seconds, have a check of the local updated web page.
File path: blog\index.html
OK to commit and push? [Yes/No] Yes
Making a git push to master
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        <modified files ...>

Finished
```
Well, I'm still afraid of making mistakes so I leave myself a chance to have a look at the local HTML pages. However, as how this site is designed, all post are loaded from a Git URL instead of a relative path. I cannot have a look at the new post content during this check but the others. I suspect that this should be relavent to the underscore prefix (i.e. `_posts/`) in the path where I store the posts. So next time I'd like to get this fixed so when I'm opening a local webpage it loads local posts, while loaded from Git Pages, it refers posts in the repository.
