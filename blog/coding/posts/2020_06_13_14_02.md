## 2. Trying to Post by Using JavaScript

So after some study about posting blogs via GitHub Page. I think at least I have to arrange the whole site into a style like: I simply write a Markdown post, and a static site is generated basing on that. 
However, I really don't like the Jekyll solution, in which way all the pages look so boring.  

I'm planning to use some JavaScript, so that there is a page that runs the script and render my Markdown posts into the site. As far as I can tell, JavaScript is running on user's browser, so that it is still following the GitHub Page static philosophy.

If you can see this, that means I succeeded :D
