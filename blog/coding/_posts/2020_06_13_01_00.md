## 1. Stupid Script Wasted One Week
![Watch Button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvfki/mvfki.github.io/master/blog/coding/images/1.jpg)
Since I'm working with a large coding project that is contributed by a lot of lab members, merging newly accepted pull requests from upstream Git repository is quite a big deal. if I don't want to mess things up when resolving the conflicts. Then I came up with a project, where the goal is to notify developers (myself) when new commits arrive in the upstream repository. I designed a UI, with a pretty looking (at least I think so) panel, a system tray that restore the closed window, and a background running loop which periodically check the number of commits... And three days after I thought I was good with it, I found there is a "Watch" button at the upper right corner of the main page of every repository.  

Anyway, these codes are still nice practice, hopefully.
