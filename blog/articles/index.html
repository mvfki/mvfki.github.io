						<h2>1. One of My Favorite Song</h2>
						<a class="image fit"><img src="images/thesecretyoullneverknow.jpg" alt="" /></a>
						<p>The original name of this song is 君の知らない物語 (Japanese), which I would translate as The Secret You'll Never Know. This song is first released as the ending theme song of 
						TV animation 化物語 (Bakemonogatari. I love the translation "Monstories", which is the mix of "monster" and "story", and corresponds to "化け物" and "物語" exactly as what these 
						words means.)</p>
						<p>The song is composed by Ryo, from Supercell, and sang by やなぎなぎ (Yanaginagi) in 2009. The figure is the cover of the single.</p>

						<h2>2. Stupid Script Wasted One Week</h2>
						<a class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
						<p>Since I'm working with a large coding project that is contributed by a lot of lab members, merging newly accepted pull requests from upstream Git repository is quite a big deal
						if I don't want to mess things up when resolving the conflicts. Then I came up with a project, where the goal is to notify developers (myself) when new commits arrive in the upstream repository. I designed a UI, with a pretty looking (at least I think so) panel, a system tray that restore the closed window, and a background running loop which periodically check the number of commits... And three days after I thought I was good with it, I found there is a "Watch" button at the upper right corner of the main page of every repository. </p>
						<p>Anyway, these codes are still nice practice, hopefully.</p>
