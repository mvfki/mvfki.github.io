<section><div class="image post"><span>2020-06-27</span><h1 id="general-flour-using-notes">General Flour Using Notes</h1><p>Since the start of self-quarantine, I've been having a lot of spare time after work. I started off cooking with flour, such as baking my own buns, toasts, pizzas, pancakes, and cakes.<br/>
At the very beginning, it was a nightmare to use a presice amount of all ingredients. I would even bring a notebook like an lab record. Eventually, after a lot of success as well as failure, I think I've got a golden ratios for how much amount of each ingredients to use. And I'd like to put them as a note here, also for sharing.<br/>
Note that I prefer using "gram", "milliliter" as the basic measure of mass and volume since I'm from China where nobody use anything else:) And here I would only share a ratio of ingredients, instead of all steps to the end.  </p><h2 id="baking-a-dry-bread"><a class="anchor" href="#baking-a-dry-bread" id="anchor-baking-a-dry-bread"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon fa-link"></i></a>Baking a dry bread</h2><p>This section is for all kinds of dry bread, such as buns and toasts. The difference between them is just how you shape the dough before the final fermentation.<br/>
- Exact values of amount for three serves
</p>
For male adult as me, the most balanced amount of flour to use for one serve is around 100-120g. I usually bake for three breakfasts thus I listed for three serves.
Here comes the point, if you want to adjust the amount of flour, for example, first try for one serve, want a smaller serve, or even bake for a group of five people, you'd definitely want a correct ratio. And this is really annoying when you want to try a small serve but it seems like you have to divide a single egg. 
- Dry - liquid mass ratio

Let's first , because what you have to do is to use the ratio at first, such as .
You will want to pay attention to the . Things like egg, milk, water, honey will all be taken account here. So when you want to try out for only one serve but do not want to divide a whole egg, you do the following:

I know that the ratio between egg and milk changes a lot, and yes, the taste changes. But if you add more milk, your dough will be too wet that it drives you mad.
For another example, when you want to try a lot of honey as a replacement of sugar, and bake two smaller serves, and you still don't want to divide an agg:

See what's happening? It is basically to 


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Flour - 120g
egg   - 1 (around 50g)
milk  - 70g
sugar - 10g
salt  - 1/8 tsp
baking powder - 1 tsp
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Flour - liquid
  1   -   1
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Finally</strong>, these two ratio is not for baking a cake or souffle pancake, which requires whipping the egg white. The property of whipped egg white is totally changed, and you have to mix the flour with the yolk batter before you mix the whipped egg white with the others. Be sure to refer to a famous YouTuber before complain to me :)</p><p>Jun. 27th, 2020</p></div></section></div>
