[Animenzzz!](https://www.youtube.com/user/Animenzzz/featured) is a pianist that is known for his classical piano arrangement for Anime songs. My top favorites are *My Dearest*, *Euterpe*, out of his nearly one hundred of pieces. Interestingly, these two songs and the one I'm talking about today all came from the same TV Anime series - *Guilty Crown*. Well, as you can tell, the series did came with a bunch of enduring original songs, as [Hiroyuki Sawano!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbJM_Y06iuUOl3hVPqYcvng) and [Ryo (Supercell)!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy9UVm-UjHqcktvxg-sS4qQ) carried it out.  

The original song of the cover released just now, *The Everlasting Guilty Crown*, is the second openning theme song for *Guilty Crown*. Honestly, the first time I listened to it, I did not give a damn about it, because the drum pattern is not varying at all and is quite noisy for me. Years later, I accidentally came back to this song, with Japanese reading skill improved, and found the lyrics are actually touching me. Also, this time I could tell that the vocalist, [Egoist!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCchlf66z1NueAv8xY117Lmw), cooperated with the instrumental so well that the meaning of the lyrics was passed to me so clearly.  

Animenzzz arranged so many tricky skills in this covering this time. I am not saying that the fancier, the better. But the meaning and the emotions from the original song need appropriate design to be reproduced on a single instrument, rather than from a band. This covering is satisfying.
