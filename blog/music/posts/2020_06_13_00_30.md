# One of My Favorite Songs
![君の知らない物語](https://mvfki.github.io/blog/music/images/1.jpg)
The original name of this song is 君の知らない物語 (Japanese), which I would translate as The Secret You'll Never Know. This song is first released as the ending theme song of TV animation 化物語 (Bakemonogatari. I love the translation "Monstories", which is the mix of "monster" and "story", and corresponds to "化け物" and "物語" exactly as what these words means.)

The song is composed by Ryo, from Supercell, and sang by やなぎなぎ (Yanaginagi) in 2009. The figure is the cover of the single.
