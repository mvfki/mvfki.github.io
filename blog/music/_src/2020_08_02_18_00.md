I made some rearrangement on a kind of well-known Anime song - *名前のない怪物* (*Namae No Nai Kaibutsu*, *Monster without A Name*), which was originally composed and arranged by [ryo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy9UVm-UjHqcktvxg-sS4qQ) and sung by [EGOIST](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCchlf66z1NueAv8xY117Lmw).  

Initially I was just trying to play some random riffs on my acoustic guitar. All of a sudden, I found it really suitable to fill in the prelude of this song. The use of the *Amaj* chord in the very beginning is making it quite different from the original arrangement. So I'm pretty happy with the outcome.  

Note that the electric guitar effect is implemented by recording the sound of acoustic guitar through the virtual electric guitar speaker, on Garage Band. I sang the vocal and harmony part myself. I know my singing and guitar playing is pretty bad. I'm just trying to pass the idea of this rearrangement, but not attempting to show off any production.  

Thanks to ryo's great master piece and thanks for listening. Meaningful and effective discussion and suggestions are appreciated!
